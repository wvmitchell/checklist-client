# Checklist App

## Description

Checklist allows you to create and manage your checklists. You can create a checklist, add items, mark
them as done and delete them. You can also collaborate with other users on the same checklist. Additionally, 
this is a Progressive Web App (PWA) which means you can install it on your device and use it offline. When 
your device is back online, the app will sync your data with the server.

## Installation
